            Payments Verification Data and Other Data We May Use

            <p>
            The Company is entitled to request data from Users in order to verify payments. This data can be either your bank card data (e.g., photo of the last six digits of your card, or a photo of a User holding a card, etc.), passport details, or another ID. The data may also be used as evidence that the Application was actually used by the User in case a dispute arises between us and the User.
            </p>
            <p>
            In case any dispute arises between the Company and the User, the Company also reserves the right to use as evidence confirming that you were actually using the WeMatcher (in some cases – as evidence of you being the real account owner) and provide to the relevant authority the following information: your Avatar; screenshots made by the system when you were searching for interlocutors; your IP-address; your country, region and city; type of browser and operation system that you were using.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>No Refunds.</b> Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, except that we may approve a refund in the form of a credit on request if exceptional circumstances exist. If you believe exceptional circumstances exist, please contact us and explain the circumstances that you believe merits a refund. We are not making any promise that we will give you a refund. If we give you a refund, we will issue the refund in the form of free services or a credit to the payment method you used for your purchase; we will not make refunds in the form of cash or check. The provision of a refund in one instance does not entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate us to provide refunds in the future, under any circumstance.
